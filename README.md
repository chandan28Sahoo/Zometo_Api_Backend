# Zometo_Api_Backend
In this project, I have used Zomato-API (https://developers.zomato.com/) to get the details of restaurants present in a particular location. You'll be asked a location to fetch the details like average cost for two people, price ranges, has online delivery or not, and cuisines of that location.
